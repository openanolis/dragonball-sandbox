# micro-http

This is a minimal implementation of the
[HTTP/1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945) and
[HTTP/1.1](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) protocols. This HTTP
implementation is stateless thus it does not support chunking or compression.

The micro-http implementation is used in production by Firecracker.

## Acknowledgement
